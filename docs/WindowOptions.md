A `Window` object can have many kinds of parameters. This small guide will help you to understand those parameters in case you want to create a window.

> **Note**: the example values are taken from Test App 1 which is a default included app for testing purposes.<br>
> In the rest of this document we'll be referring to it as *`ta1`* due to it's app ID.<br>
> Some of the parameters below are not needed and shown as (unset).

| isSystemPinned         | `false` | `bool`   | (unset)                     | App is automatically pinned to the taskbar and can be unpinned only if `isUnpinnable` is set.                                               |
| isUnpinnable           | `true`  | `bool`   | (unset)                     | Allow the app to be unpinned in the taskbar? Only allowed if `isUserPinned` or `isSystemPinned` is set.                                     |
| opensWindow            | `true`  | `bool`   | (unset)                     | Does this app open a window? If `true`, then a window opens when the app is launched.                                                       |
| app                    | `null`  | `string` | `C:/Programs/TestApp1"`     | The app file to open. Takes path from local storage. Can be set to a URL if `openInNewTab` is set to true.                                  |
| openInNewTab           | `false` | `bool`   | (unset)                     | Opens the `app` parameter in a new tab. Only works if `app` is a URL.                                                                       |
| style                  | `null`  | `string` | `width:800px;height:600px;` | The window's inline CSS style. Applied to the element with the app's ID.                                                                    |
| canHaveMultipleWindows | `false` | `bool`   | `false`                     | Specifies if the app can have multiple windows. (A limit can be set using `windowLimit`, default is 25)                                     |
| windowLimit            | 25      | `number` | (unset)                     | The app's window limit. Only takes effect when `canHaveMultipleWindows` is set to `true`.                                                   |
